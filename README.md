# DARUKA-VLab

DARUKA-VLab is a software-based Virtual Laboratory designed to demonstrate
the architecture, working principles, and autonomous behavior of a
firefighting robot through interactive 3D visualization and simulation.

This project was developed as part of an Open Innovation hackathon,
emphasizing software simulation with optional hardware validation.

---

## Objectives
- To provide an interactive Virtual Lab for understanding autonomous firefighting robots
- To visualize robot components using a 3D web-based model
- To simulate fire detection and extinguishing behavior in software
- To bridge virtual experimentation with real-world robotic systems

---

## Virtual Lab Features
- Interactive 3D robot model (GLB format)
- Click-to-explore robot components
- Software-based firefighting simulation
- Clear visualization of robot decision-making logic
- Web-based deployment for easy access

---

## System Overview
The robot consists of:
- Wheeled locomotion system
- Vision-based fire detection (YOLO)
- Flame sensor for redundancy
- Aerosol-based fire extinguishing mechanism
- Central control using Raspberry Pi 5

The Virtual Lab mirrors this architecture in software.
